<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In Fall 2017,  Louisville Metro used crowdsourcing to identify locations in Louisville with the highest demand for EV chargers. Over 200 respondents helped identify dozens of locations around the city where there is a demand for better EV charging infrastructure. Their responses will help determine where to prioritize the construction of new charging stations both internally and with partners.</p>
